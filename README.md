# MACHINE LEARNING
Machine Learning part in this project is to create an BMI Model classification, classify child health status (Gizi Baik, Overweight, Underweight, Stunting).

## BMI Child Calculator Prediction
A BMI (Body Mass Index) child calculator is a tool designed to assess the body mass index of children and adolescents. BMI is a numerical measurement that evaluates an individual's body fat in relation to their height and weight. It is commonly used as an indicator of whether a person has a healthy weight for their height.

The BMI child calculator takes into account the age, gender, height, and weight of a child or adolescent. The calculated BMI is then plotted on specific growth charts that are age and gender-specific. These charts help determine whether the child's BMI falls within a healthy range or if it is normal, underweight, overweight, or stunting 

## Tflite Model Deployment
We decided to use .tflite format for our BMI prediction model so we can deploy the model directly to the android app using tflite interpreter.

## Dataset
Dataset that used is from Kaggle and a local Puskemas
